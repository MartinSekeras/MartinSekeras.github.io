											<h2>A Little About Me</h2>
											<p>“Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad.” – Cory House</p>
										</header>
										<p>
											I've been tinkering with all sorts of languages since I was 12 years old. I've started with Java coding
											Minecraft mods. I then moved to HTML and CSS for a while to "Try it Out" but never really took off anywhere.
											That's when i thought to myself why not try making games. So I looked up how to make games and started
											playing with Unity and made some prototypes that no longer exist because back in the day I never thought I would
											be Game Developer or at least a student... for now.
										</p>
										<p>
											Currently I am a student learning game programming mainly in C++ and C# with Unity as well as some other things like
											3D Modeling, AI, Mobile Games Development, Game Engine Development and Architecture, Apllied Mechanics and Shader Programming.
										</p>
										<p>
											This is not be all and end all as I've had some experience with other languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Action Script, Java,
											Visual Basic and I have National Certificate in Computer Systems Development.
